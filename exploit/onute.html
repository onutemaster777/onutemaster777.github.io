<br><b>Onute (known as IUS) is a Lithuanian genius BonziWORLD owner, Gmod gamer, GoAnimator, YouTuber, <a href="ytpmv.html">YTPMVer</a> , Redditor, Discorder, Xbox gamer, YTPer, <a href="samsungfunclub.html">Samsung Fun Club</a> fan and JavaScript programmer.</b> It is in community at 2017 called "<b>son</b>" on the active official <a href="bw.html">BonziWORLD</a> Member. But other way, <a href="heyjoeway.html">Joseph Judge</a> have shut down this website, because Onute added the issue that user of the Soundcloud "<b>hex</b>" is dead on the memecrew. And that's why he shut down this website.
<br>
<br>On 2018, the random Anonymous given this script to "<b>spam with text behh</b>" on official site of <a href="bw.html">BonziWORLD</a> website. Also may people dislike the BonziWORLD , they leave for spamming and come back on the site to re-mute them.
<br>
<br>On 2019, <a href="ics.html">Seamusmario</a> hates Onute, because she's a psychopath and a famous person that joins every time. He bans me, then I used VPN to be "<b>unbanned</b>". And they still give my ban, BonziWORLD console is still seeing my IP and Seamus should to stop.
<br>
<br>On 2019 December 12th, a channel "<b>onute saulute thekantapapa</b>" with 3,600 subscribers on YouTube, but it has disappeared to other way because he deleted the entire content to him. And that's why parents told him to delete my channel for bad things. It's the video that called "<a href="onuteworst.html">washing my foots and hands</a>" is not applicable and funny videos that show "<b><i>pornographics</i></b>".
<br>
<br>Everyone sees me on school, now everyone criticizes and spys me that it was doing, then I lost my phones and laptops because I am punished for this. Now I have a small phones called Huawei Vodafone 845 and LG GB102.
<br>
<br>Now I have a birthday, now I have headset to hear basses and music like that! Seriously, I was proud with this. He didn't teached my lesson, so sake.
<br>
<br>On 2020 for early months, <a href="bagelchip.html">BagelChip</a> banned the person is a Onute as Lithuanian person to break JavaScript and left this then she was got banned for life for being a troll on the site and hack the owner on the site isn't a lie.
<br>
<br>On 2020 for skips, Onute now creates the server to name "FuckWORLD" (it's now <a href="bwfe.html">BonziWORLD FE</a> for big update). Before that updates, it updates too much and stopped there on the eighth month and staying site for life.
<br>
<br>On 2020 for <a href="gofag.html">GoAnimate</a>, it hosted on early March 2020, it was called "<b>GoAnimate Remastered</b>", then more weeks insulted <b><u>MY NAME IS USERNAME</u></b>, then more months it was called "<b>GoAnimate Unpatchable</b>", then  turned a site into "<b>Wrapper Online Remastered</b>", because it's the law of the name usable "<b>GoAnimate</b>" is a company word to break the law. She started other site called "<b>Wrapper Online</b>", then on November 30th turned into "<b>Wrapper Online: Gold</b>" for expensive features and more tracks added. She insulted to other users like "<b><u>2Epik4u</u></b>", "<b><u>MJ the Spirit</u></b>" or "<b><u>TheSodaDrinkers</u></b>" on this direct message to a user. I got banned from <u>Wrapper Central</u> (GoAnimate City), because I am so dumb like that, but staff is only have "<b><u><i>banned me</b></u></i>" on the server and I am not quit to GoAnimate website while they will <b>BAN</b> me.
<br>
<br>On this server of 2020, Onute "<b>GreenSkullAnimate</b>" is a Discord user then they raided the server for more users, they will not stop, just continue to raid with these repeating words. Usable "<b>raid</b>" word is a break of word to other sites. They asked to delete my server, then I deleted this server eventually. Other <a href="gofag.html">GoAnimators</a> and other people have DMed to the owner on the site is probably made.
<br>
<br>On this host of December 2020, Onute now will host "<b>Wrapper Online: Gold</b>" foreverly, but it will more users can join and create each other. They can just update the video and thumbnail may change it, it's a troll.
<br>
<br>On December 2020, ICS now hates Onute, because he didn't shut down BonziWORLD, he's now a toxic person then eventual makes fun of him.
