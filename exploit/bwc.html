<h2>classic.bonzi.world</h2>
<p>Classic.bonzi.world is a website by <a href="bagelchip.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BagelChip</a> at 2020, this is classic website, original but no changes (especially for Bootstrap CSS).</p>

<p>Classic.bonzi.world have a issue: <b>onmouseover</b> isn't patched and taking over for viruses.</p>
<p>After late 2021, foodz patched "onmouseover" YouTube exploit. Now, kiddies can't use virus anymore in this site. But they generally wanting to crash the site as a "new exploit" means good idea to crash the server before onmouseover is patched.</p>
<p>Around the spergs and niggers are still invading the Cloudflare protected site shit and they grab the Cloudflare's retarded IP address and they tried to DDoS the shit but it didn't work. Afterwards, Cloudflare is a super freaking batman that throws the packets like Ninja Gaiden sperm ass when kiddies can't go through the Nathan Thompson's shit IP, all the sites are Cloudflare shit protected. But in last day, it's November 9th. BonziWORLD Classic remains to shut down or not maybe, because foodz is also try to shut down the bastard siteass due to kiddies. Now probably after that, kiddies won't be returning to BonziWORLD again. Kiddies may still coming, finding other sites from me, Jy, Sam Workman, Mario sites. Unfortunately, Seamus's BonziWORLD service is discontinued, because of natural extra spergs are giving viruses and fucking spam and spread the threats for no reason, and that's why he shut down the site and making it discontinued.</p>
