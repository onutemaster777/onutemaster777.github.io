<p><b>ICS (known as itzchris swing, TAAAAAAAAANK, ItzCrazyScout, CrazyMediumScout, Seamusmario, Seamusmario 55 or QuartiezTheScoutMan76) (Real name Seamus Cremeen (formerly known as "Seamus Cremeens"), age 16, state location Lorain, Ohio, United States, router Armstrong Cable aka ZoomInternet, IP 72.23.210.24 (IP changed, new IP 24.239.39.21))</b> is a Steam gamer, Angry birds gamer, Minecraft 1.12.3 upgraded gamer, Minecraft 1.12.2 modder, Garry mod gamer, TF2 gamer and BonziWORLD revived plus owner. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, it created <b><a href="bw2.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD II</a></b> without any <b>MASH</b> (<i>Microsoft Agent Scripting Helper</i>) character spritesheets. Later, it was an idea to shut down the inactive website of BonziWORLD II is because of people never joins the website.</p>
<p>ICS is a well-known creator and Gmod gamer. But a few months later it saws; more children of 10-year old's are ruining <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> to destroy with JavaScript and breaking nudities with sexes for others, he didn't know his preparation, he stopped the reaction videos because they wouldn't react and why they getting populace down. ICS shutted down a website right now, that justly kiddies will stop throwing, executing and ruining over of <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD site</a>.</p>

<p>Why normies ruining commands? <i>I wish to throw it away on deepest underwater eaten by black shark upon your fishy organ!</i></p>

<p>Another message from <b><a href="zander.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Zander Blake</a></b> is the person for ICS is needing to go to the <b>vacation</b>, because they have been ruined our lives and pedophile fault. he is no longer an <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> member anymore, he now plays <b>Garry's Mod</b> (<i>GMOD</i>) on Steam is costly not much! he plays <b>Team Fortress 2</b> (<i>TF2</i>), because the game of <b style="color: orange;">Valve Corporation</b> was great. Extraordinarily, he posted an message that what happened with their site.</p>
<p>At the November start, he hosted the regular <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD server</a> with changed godmode, because he shut down an "<b>BonziWORLD II</b>" website due to kiddies fault once again. But <b><a href="geri.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Bowgart</a></b> (<i>Geri1940</i>) have joined on <b><a href="bw2.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BW2</a></b> because <b><a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">IUS</a></b> exposed the link to redirect an link for BonziWORLD site and guess banned him.</p>

<p>At the November end, he was changed the ports, because kiddies could find the mark for the port and ruin it. he deleted an <b>discord server</b> for third time, second is <b><a href="bwr.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD Revived</a></b>, and first one was Quarantine Zone for <b>BonziWORLD Revived</b> due a <b>COVID-19 isolations</b>. That's why ICS has deleted the <b>BonziWORLD server</b> for three times.</p>

<p>At January 2021, he made a "prank" on BonziWORLD Revived, this video is a prank but also it's just a prank but kiddies think is that real BonziWORLD Revived by clicking the yellow button or README link but the entire page is faded out then message says: it is actually Howler script and removed socket client from the website. Message pops is that a prank of the website and they wanted to message as the crying moment. ICS were already doing this prank, because of the kiddies ruining and it least of age 12 skids ruining this site. Nobody wants to chat somewhere on BWR, because of the kiddies were war'ed the site with floods.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>

<p>He posted a description:</p>
<p><b>I'll tell you why. During the first year of this terrible bonziworld server, We didn't have much. We basically had fun. Until later on, These manchildren came up to us and started acting like that the website is their life, and started rule breaking like crazy. Seriously, It's been 1 fucking year since this came out, and these manchildren are trying to bring it back. Not even Adela, the creator of New! BonziWORLD approves their behavior. We have detected that the average age of <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> Users are 7 years old. That's fucking serious. Not even their parents deal with this. My sibling's father didn't like this website because it had swear words. BonziWORLD was intended to be for Mature Audiences. Meanwhile, in the logs. We've found out that <a href="geri.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Bowgart</a> was doing sexual roleplays with Diogo Mendes and Diogo enjoyed it. This isn't right, like at all. I got IP Banned from mintmaru.io over a immature action over open source software. I went crazy over Adela using my open source assets, and that was really regretful, and I'm sorry for what I've done. None of the mature users (such as: clip888) even come to the website anymore. It is all of their fault. More people are losing interest because of them children. "PLEZ I WANT BONZIWORLD REVIVD BAK PLEAS BRING IT BAK PLS" NO. N o. I don't want to bring back a monstrosity of a chat website. That'll even make me lose friends as well. The creator of <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> "<a href="heyjoeway.html" style="text-decoration: none;">heyjoeway</a>" deeply regrets of making this project, and it's all because of these children. Nobody even understands the fact that I'm really, really mad at these users. About 90% of my audience are <a href="fags.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Bonzifags</a>, and I'm not happy about that. I want my fans to be nicer and be better than these other users. My reputation is also crumbling enough. And it's all because of the children. Acting like 5 year old's to other people, doing NSFW Roleplays (like groomed <a href="losky.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Losky</a> did 3 years ago in 2020), <a href="fags.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Doxxing</a> themselves, making people lose interest in the chat website entirely, and also acting like a average Go!Animator. They "ground" the users like they're their parents. I even got "grounded" because I abused an exploit on <a href="bwc.html" style="text-decoration: none;">classic.bonzi.world</a>. Now, If this post hurts your teeny tiny feelings and you are ready to harass me, Go get a life. <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> isn't your life. Nature is. And you deserve better than going in this shitty website. Go do other things, like Gaming, Schooling, or whatever. And stop playing on this monstrosity of a website.</b></p>

<p>Preliminarily, that'll makes a truthful story about for <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> pedophile and kiddies fault. Why you use the website as monstrosity? You shouldn't know this, now read the description what he ICS said or else I will remove your eyes off, you will see <b>NOWHERE</b>! Get your life you fuckin pussy. Nobody loves you, so play your interesting recorded <a href="tas.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Tool-assisted speedrun</a> games on emulators if you like or not. ICS hates <a href="bwr.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD Revived</a> itself. What you are going to stalk like Mallow or Geno from <b>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</b> on <b style="color: blueviolet;">SNES videogame console</b>.</p>

<p>In 2020 for later, ICS hates <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a>, it's because, he is a overeaten poor son like Loskythecopydog77 and doing as an kiddie fault like for others. Onute has a mean of mentality, to beat and beg ICS for absolutely nothing, they can reveal the location for <b>Onute's house</b>, and that where is.</p>

<p>But now was good again and <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> hates <b><a href="itzchris.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ItzChris</a></b> and <b><a href="losky.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Loskythecopydog77</a></b>, because he's a toxic on this community.</p>

<p>ICS's birthday is <b>2020/10/29</b>, what is that age, <i>I don't know.</i></p>

<p>he made a Onute's non-styled GoAnimate rant:</p>

<p><b>Let me guess - Onute was being a serious kiddie right now, it has come to my attention that he has ranted on the owner of BonziWORLD: Revived, itzcrazyscout (known as SeamusMario55, or Seamus for short.). I bet he was being a fucking normie, well, he just made a GoAnimate-styled rant, this also counts as cyberbullying since it's the so-called "out-of-user" rant. Itzcrazyscout doesn't deserve to get ranted. Guys, if you want to be just like Onute, then don't you dare. If you are trying to take trolls seriously, then don't do that, just simply ignore trolls. That's all for the revenge (Non-GoAnimate-styled rant).</b></p>

<h2>Personality</h2>

<p>ICS is doing bans for <b>kiddies</b> work.</p>

<p>For later, it created the account <b>Seamusmario on GitHub</b>. Second this boy creates <b>Miraheze account</b> and his wiki container. But it was locked and removed because <b>kiddies</b> ruining Miraheze wikis, he tried to put an restriction to stop editing them.</p>

<p>On YouTube, the wrong grammar of Losky videos: "<b>losky new vedio</b>", but later it's still faggot. But he deleted the channel and make the another one called "<b>ItzCrazyScout</b>" then uploaded his video called "<b>rhino</b>". This video is only the commercial for blue dinosaur/rex was eventually dancing with bad quality.</p>

<h2>Likes</h2>
<h3>Loves</h3>
<h5>What this guy loves it and makes fun of.</h5>

<p><b><a href="itzchris.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ItzChris</a></b></p>
<p>They're meaning of ItzChris, ItzChris doesn't want to be pope. But it's now a toxic and cyberbully innocent children for no reason.</p>

<p><b><a href="zander.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Zander</a></b></p>
<p>Zander Blake/Fender Blake is an admin on <b>BonziWORLD II</b>, makes amazing videos. But later on the month it has changed himself for opinion.</p>

<p><b><a href="danieltr.html" style="text-decoration: none;">PurpleOctopus (danieltr52)</a></b></p>
<p>This guy does absolutely nothing, he only kicks you when you are doing something wrong. He was <b>Danieltr52</b> when I saw on old BonziWORLD Revived website with special directory colors from Windows.</p>

<p><b><a href="bagelchip.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BagelChip (Nathan Thompson)</a></b></p>
<p>BagelChip is a partner and owner on bonzi.world and classic.bonzi.world, that bans permanently users (I'd got banned by owner on the site, it is soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo psychopathic!) and uses Cloudflare to hide IP and block DDOS attacks. Tell me what is the IP address of Nathan Thompson's bonzi.world real IP address? Not Cloudflare. I wish to go either to be unbanned without Cloudflare cause. He port forwarded him.</p>

<p><b>CVM</b></p>
<p>CHOCOLATEMAN, icanttellyou, yellows111 and DFU start love of ICS, it's because they talk about to block him this address and put the restriction for it. But later it was quitted on the CVM, because they don't like it so much and troublemakers ruining it.</p>

<p><b>Windows93</b><p>
<p>It started to like Win93 and copies it the background of BonziWORLD revived. But later it was left on this community, he sometimes make this.</p>

<p><b><a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute (start of life)</a></b><p>
<p>Onute was not a hypocrite for now, it tells how to host the server. At this other disgusting hour a website was hosted and worked perfect.</p>

<p><b>Glitch56</b></p>
<p>He is a Spritesheet maker (<i>fixing sounds</i>) and got a <b>pope</b>. But then, he loses <b>pope</b> when he didn't know how to make a <b>BonziWORLD project</b>. But he's kind to leave discord often because there is no awesome features on the server. But later, he came back on the Discord, then everyone hate Onute, because he made a grounded video out of ICS and anger to him.</p>

<h3>Hates<h3>
<h5>Who the guy has a mental problems and became a kiddie, GoTurd, GoFag, beggar, forcer or even worse thing is calling an asshole himself as name.</h5>

<p><b><a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute Saulute</a></b><p>
<p>Onute has mental problems with ICS. He makes fun of ICS, somewhere makes grounded videos out of ICS, rants him with IVONA 2 voices, doing footage videos of BonziWORLD, doing spam videos on BWR and BW2 (<i>we say "beh" as now "behh" in Russians, why is that popular to execute JavaScript? Nonsense thing. Why you would to spam to every BonziWORLD! I'm gonna ban you for inappropriate behavior and that's you will get deserve to be robot in 12 months from your ENTIRE IP address to be failed, change if you want, but I can still ban and see your IP with superpowers! Don't use puppeteer on Node.js, Use any website to screenshot</i>), doing JavaScript at the same time, but this time he got banned for being a kiddie and <a href="gofag.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Gofag</a> (<i>These grounded threats saying "<b>grounded</b>", GROUNDED THREATS DON'T WORK TOWARDS A PERSON</i>). ICS is just a <b>neutral</b> of <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> talk her.</p>
<p>On December 2020, ICS hates Onute once again, because he didn't shut down BonziWORLD, this person may caused for nightmare that Onute is getting a revenge like king from BonziWORLD. On January 3rd 2020, QuartiezTheScoutMan76 striked an Chorded video as called "<b>effects</b>" (<i>like YTPMV Community</i>), he needs to abide a user to be terminated, because he's like a Loskythecopydog77 as a guy.</p>
<p>On January 4th, ICS striked another video with .veg replace "<b>QUARTIEZTHESCOUTMAN76 SECOND ZONE</b>" on YouTube, reported that video for few hours ago. ItzCrazyNil has 2 copyright strikes, one more has more survival challenge to be expired in 180 days (3 months per one strike), QuartiezTheScoutMan76 made a video out of Onute, MSAgent shorts, Bonzi gets copyright strike and typing keyboard sounds, that Bonzi's mouth like a fax is reading the sound.</p>
<p>On January 5th, ICS came back on my official Discord Server, this owner gave a moderator role for ICS, other people joined like that, and that day has been ruined and nuked. TGTT members have nuked and hacked his server, like a challenge that everyone is ruining. Perhaps, delete the server and create private server for BonziWORLD, this owner will not give him a link once again before it gets hacked. ICS funs of Onute, it swears, it uses lot of fucking words like "<b>nigger</b>", "<b>bitch</b>" or "<b>retard</b>", but ICS doesn't care what it means so.</p>
<p>On January 6th, ICS ruined the server again, and saying asshole to him. Even this server was still hacked, he gave a Onute image to delete the account, but no, he doesn't want to delete his main account. Imagine that, this is Super Waluigi's Challenge, delete your discord account. Wow, this is a image that I can give them for a punishment, thank you. ICS left and destroyed again, ICS wouldn't just go to BonziWORLD, because he doesn't want into a computer and log his new IP, they will be caught; if someone visits on your site.</p>
<p>On January 8th, ICS striked the last "itzcrazynil minecraft" an blue rex dinosaur video before it has been uploaded, YouTube terminated "itzcrazynil minecraft"'s channel for getting three copyright strikes. However, it was other decide he was not doing anything illegal, legally creating alternate accounts is actually <b>sockpuppetry</b> that creates too much and getting these channels terminated, because of the troll of Jabba Saulute/Onute Saulute. Somewhere has named "Discord World" is the same person did that and re-uploaded his videos and his Samsung fun club content, because of the termination of itzcrazynil minecraft. Fortunately, ICS teached Daniel an lesson to not be stolen, but he does, he's not barricading them and getting stolen. Onute/Daniel/Jabba thinks it is just wanted to show his archive, if the stolen video is taken down, it gonna to reupload it once again to another website, not from YouTube.</p>
<p>On February 15th and 16th at Valentine's Day, he started to criticize "bad guys" for not shutting BonziWORLD servers. But everyone don't like them to fun of him so. Also, the bad guys just called Onute an "jabba", because he's totally fat and were filmed stock of bath; as is naked and posting around on YouTube. But later it has deleted from December 12th 2019. But later for February 16th at Valentine's Day, he started to criticize and give people a grounded and dox threats to him and getting upset for him, because. Not even Daniel did not increase his braincells, he only leaks the braincells to make Sparta Remix at February 17th. He always criticizes at the server of GeriWORLD, but it was now crappy, disgustive, making shit of the server to join. Only one is criticizes because of fat issues, he only made the video of Sony Xperia M4 Aqua video is showing his bath not letting legs to get up and he's actually fat, absolutely not! He started nowadays in August is a bad idea to get, everyone on December got a hatred out of me. itzchris swing (as known ICS) made video out of Onute/Daniel/Jabba with rant which I posted in, second video "onute 2", third video "onute makes ics grounded video for times in a row". Also a Winfinity - that a little boy - he blocked on winhost.gq, because he knows my IP, because its no IP tracking, but it will be actually illegal to grab it and DoS him.</p>

<p>From other previous time, Onute has hosted the copycat version of <b>BonziWORLD: Revived</b> server, some moments later it came back on my server and ban me for assigned IP (<i>is it most way to type this "<b>::1</b>" for <b>localhost</b>?</i>), because I am pooping in a toilet for somewhere, a few months later it was broken and unrecoverable by Losky and hackers fault.</p>

<p>Submerged from another to the clean server, I pasted all folders to be safe.</p>

<p><b><a href="itzchris.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ItzChris</a></b></p>
<p>ICS now hates ItzChris because he was a toxic, harasser and was a drama on BonziWORLD community, and then got banned from all of BonziWORLD families. He is a fucking <b><a href="fags.html" style="text-decoration: none;">dramafag</a></b>.</p>

<p><b>He may get <a href="ban.html" style="text-decoration: none;">banned</a> as soon for doing drama and raids.</b></p>

<p><b><a href="losky.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Loskythecopydog77</a></b></p>
<p>Losky was a fetish sexual manipulative crook, and ICS will still hate him peacefully. He still hates him. Now.</p>

<p><b>Diogo Mendes</b></p>
<p>Some people call <b>Doggis</b> to Diogo Mendes, but this channel has been terminated for being a <b>Doggis</b> and ICS hates Diogo because he is a <b>Doggis</b> and a <b>kiddie</b> then demoted his admin, he is <b>temporarily banned</b>!</p>

<p>Richard Ray has re-uploaded the video because Diogo Mendes Archive removed or hided almost all videos.</p>

<p>Second, he exposes the location of Portugal from another guy and where Diogo Mendes live on that exposes families, phone numbers, locations, names and anything else. I exposed him on classic.bonzi.world because he didn't know it. One more thing, almost needs to be died and he gonna to be arrested for murdering people in Portugal.</p>

<p>But today he was now good again like a <b>Onute</b>.</p>

<p><b><a href="geri.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Geri1940/Geri2020/Bowgart</a></b></p>
<p>Geri is a Hungarian 12-13 year old. he made a video for a few months called "<b>FUCK YOU ITSCRAZYSCOUT!</b>" then Geri was removed that video because more users hate and banish her opinions and hurt the feelings of ICS. He uses a Galaxy A40 (SM-A405FN/DS) to make videos. He can't handle his hate of <b>ItzCrazyScout</b>, criticizes and dislikes because he still needs to learn how to.</p>

<p><b>CollabVM</b></p>
<p>The July of time guest with random numbers just said: <i>The one word he said, and banned for eventual years for not having access</i>.</p>

<p>ICS have banned <b>CollabVM users</b> for 5 years because guests are SUPER tired to visit an website.</p>
<br>
<h1>What happens next?</h1>
<p>Seamus may decided to host BonziWORLD again with witch hut theme, however, it discontinued the service due to kiddies fault. The owner is trying to impress and explain these BonziWORLD websites and he never hosts in. Seamus asked "new account" if he can shut down the website, but the answer is "NO". No means no, naturally he won't shut down the website, but only way is to PDoS the website and make permanently down and damage the IP address forever. Daniel has no difficult ways if he was PDoSed, time to call ISP to change the IP address. Fortunately, he changed the behavior in a few months ago from provoking and doing weird behaviour as yoo like me. Seamus is good again and never criticize the fat owner again.</p>
<p>In April 2022, Seamus has became friends again with me. I entered BWR+ when I came back on BonziWORLD Community. Seamus has a problem, he accidentally blacklisted me for using VPN service. Then, we became friends again, doing Tacotron 2 (and yeah I am working more voices so enjoy!!!) and more. Seamus hates DanieLtr for good because Daniel did on TMAFE for bad behavior and Seamus psychologically gone mad out of him. We're friends with Seamus. Oh, and then Jy, Randumb, Ardakirac became friends again too, because we are all partnered.</p>
