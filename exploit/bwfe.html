<p><b>BonziWORLD FE</b> (<i>also known as The Fastest Edition</i>) - a chatting fastest website (<q>it's not fast at all</q>).</p>

<p>It was hosted by Gediminas Miliauskas.</p>

<p>BonziWORLD FE has a domain: <a href="http://78.63.40.199:8080" style="text-decoration: none;">http://78.63.40.199:8080</a>.</p>

<p>The owner of this site can't update the site because she lost his/her interest to add more features into the website, so she stopped there, but it is still up.</p>

<p>Domain "onuteworld.tk" was removed because ICS removed this website. Now it turned into IP address. IP addresses are unremovable, it's permanent.</p>

<p>The owner on the site is still will not going to update BonziWORLD FE because it's in the final version of the site, and the owner said:</p>

<p><i>Read this said of text:</i></p>

<p><b>Thank you for visiting BonziWORLD FE, but I'm not going to update my site because it's the nuts and I can't think about it anymore. BonziWORLD FE is still a website going back and controversial pity of the website, it's not going to vanish an website for life. And we would to like, say "Thank you. BonziWORLD FE fans." for collaborating my content and earthed content of BonziWORLD fantasy features. I can't take it anymore, it's disgusting and hatred content out of me, ruin all if you want like a kiddie, but BonziWORLD FE is still the fantasy website with monstrosity. 9 year old's could ruin anything they want, BonziWORLD isn't your bot from your assistance. Try joining another BonziWORLD sites, not visiting BonziWORLD FE. BonziWORLD FE is going down on the next year, let's see when it will be alive? Visiting BonziWORLD FE was a slow website, I'm going to host on Ngrok or Cloudflare website, if they will think when I host something else and hides my IP. Nobody can DDoS me for a little terabit. You can't do anything with existing Cloudflare, Cloudflare is your boss, not poor orange clouded server-side can't make any DDoS speeds. And don't like to say that you will abuse me: PLZ UPDAT BONZIWORLD FE RIGT NOW OR UR GRONDED FOR 42 BILLION FORVERS GO TO UR ROM NOW! BonziWORLD FE can't take it anymore. Signing off. Play out something else and thank you very much.</b></p>

<h2>About the website</h2>
<p>Well, about the website, the website is a generic non-ban feature.</p>

<p>He stopped the website and hosts the website forever until the next day set.<p>

<p>So this website is looking to be updated. Languages were removed, only Spanish and Serbian languages, Buttons with the images, CSS transparency, and even more.</p>

<h2>!!!THE MOST IMPORTANT THING!!!</h2>

<p>I had enough of Djordje to translate everything into a Serbian language, JUST GO TO UNITED KINGDOM NOT A SERBIA RIGHT?? he's so overweight boy and go to middle school and beat your stomach in a middle school's bell you should get a mental problems and explusion problems.</p>

<p>OH MY GOD DJORDJE! I CANNOT BELIEVE YOU REQUEST THE LANGUAGE AND I HAVE BEEN TO QUIT ON BONZIWORLD FE! BECAUSE OF THIS, YOU ARE DISRESPECTFUL, UNMANNERRED AND HYPOCRITE! HOW DARE YOU REQUEST THE LANGUAGE! ALSO YOU KNOW THAT YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO REQUEST ANYTHING, I'M TIRED FOR ANYTHING ON A SINGLE BONZIWORLD THAT WE LIKE! NOW I DISLIKE BONZIWORLD FOR ANYTHING ELSE! YOU KNOW WHAT? THAT'S IT! YOU ARE GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED FOR THE REST OF THE LIFE! NOW GO TO YOUR ROOM AND DON'T MAKE GROUNDED VIDEO OUT OF ME OR I WILL REPORT YOUR ACCOUNT IMMEDIATELY SO YOU DON'T MAKE MY BASE TO US, OR ELSE I WILL USE RANSOMWARE LIKE MICROSOFT TECH SUPPORT, THEN I WILL NEW WITH US AND ANNOUNCE FIRST TO YOU! AND YOU ARE NOT MY FRIENDS BECAUSE YOU ARE MAGGOT!</p>

<p>Djordje says: WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA I HATE ONUTE WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWAWA!</p>

<p>Djordje, you are grounded for 4928 tranquilities! Go to your room now!</p>

<p>He is a <a href="fags.html" style="text-decoration: none;">languagefag</a> and <a href="fags.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Djordjefag</a>.</p>

<p>This guy just made the rules, FAQ, ToS, Copyright disclaimer under section 1976 (copy this if you need that for disclaim this video), updated our README, custom FAQ and more.</p>

<p>So this guy whatever can update everything when any person just requests them.</p>

<p>You can go to this page called "<a href="http://78.63.40.199:8080/wiki" style="text-decoration: none;">OnuteWIKI</a>" for the vandalized wiki they can't edit pages, so, for promise you need to download the compressed file and then free edit (Click Instructions link page on OnuteWIKI and then download this file), so only an owner can do with Notepad++ after the request is available.</p>

<h2>About the DDoS</h2>
<p>On 2020 January, February and March, itself for DDoS attacks are reached by a real hacker. he knows how to leak Node.js memory and crash the PC home server further.

<p>OK <a href="itzchris.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ITZCHRIS</a> UR GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED GROUNDED FOR 305294256425498345349249582894 eras GO TO YOUR ROOM NOW IMMEDIATELY FOR IN THE SIGHT! Itzchris: hey onute, you cant ground me for no fuckin' reason i am not a kiddie you are a kiddie so i will combine the words "onute + kiddie = onutefag" so onute, are you a gofag? basically, grounded threats don't work for this, you have gonna to die for the big meatball. so then you have to teach yourselves bastard of barbecue spaghetti, SEAMUS THROW THE MEGA MEATBALL! *throws the big meatball once* *then splats like kamehameha* *onute lost the hp -99999 so in dbz goku, vegeta, son goku, piccolo, more chars. are weak than super saiyan frieza and majin buu* *game over yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah*

<p>THE HOPEFUL GOOD NEWS! ItzChris was a toxic on BonziWORLD Revived community, now he's banned all of BWR families. I think ItzChris will get revenge of ICS in Ohio, United States when lifts in random location.

<p>On today this time, they can't prefer to DDoS this site anymore, it's very impossible to get router hacked, it was an arrest by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) or got punished by parents, it providers by Telia Lietuva AB.

<p>Some has a new update, it putted from another location with the servers, Rietavas Municipality not Klaipėda Municipality.

<p>Klaipėda Municipality is still a new place, but it's in underwater, gonna to be weird.

<p>It looks like an Cloudflare racism. So what Cloudflare cloud said: BLING BLING CRACK ZING GONG, HERE COMES, THE HEAVENLY PROPORTION.

<p>His Cloudflare logo's appearance, the logo is using vector graphics format, the logo of the sun shining out like a star and the clouds like a schizophrenic dream but thus world does not exist, only clouds are white, NOT an orange!

<h2>About his server clone</h2>
<p><a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> cannot shut down the server, because it need to make online otherwise they can't join for this.

<p>itzcrazyscout logs in <a href="bwr.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD: Revived</a> clones (you maybe remembered for <a href="onuteworld.html" style="text-decoration: none;">OnuteWORLD: Revived</a> is the clone of <a href="bwr.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD Revived</a>): "Onute won't leave me alone", "Did you mute me?", "Ok then. I will ban you myself", "Onute, please shut this server down.", "You have 2 minutes for the DMCA", "If you don't shut this server, you may get the consequences", "Onute, this is serious business.", "I am Seamus, Onute".

<p>Onute and evil haters who hosted the server and port forwarded him (Onute's router <i>Residential Gateway - ADB Broadband</i>), and the clones on the server are not allowed for use. Only one person: Onute just hosting their server without permission but they doesn't care about their shutdowns because we can lost it them right now, so itzcrazyscout/ICS, if you watching this, I'm tired with your actions, there's no playing around at me, farewell you are psychopathy hunter.

<p>On this June, the Revived clone was temporary broken but it broke by real CollabVM users (I just got banned forever for not being leaving, just so I will use TP-Link WR740N 150Mbps if they put me like an demon) and Loskythecopydog77's hackers, but she cannot believe it they've shut down as permanent for being broken, but don't worry it will back them up files to the new repository.

<p>I just found the TP-Link WR740N box, so there's no CD on this box, so i'll do the setup wizard for use PPPoE DSL line. DSL line will across everywhere when you plug the power cord (some areas not available, you have to contact your ISP to know the location what you are).

<p>TP-Link WR740N was a new router, but it hasn't used for opposite years, but it's not working, it makes no difference for that, you have to call ISP to get a new IP.

<p>My internet sucks DSL lines keep reconnecting, and receiving the error, but it will back like one or two minutes to get resolved.

<p>I got a new router called "Technicolor TG582n" from Telia Lietuva AB, now he went in Finland again because she will get fired or something! I have port re-forwarded them to make website work again. The IP address is not different, its still same for my old router called ADB broadband, but now it's Technicolor TG582n, why would that connection to be lost forever? You should change it every years! Good!

<p>About for a few minutes, New BonziWORLD: Revived was back and this is a clone, but it's getting too old so Onute can't update the server otherwise it could get sued or DMCA'ed. DMCA is from USA and fake takedown. So that Onute remains the clone of BonziWORLD: Revived server, keeps alive for your communication (<i>PLS DONT SUE ME PLS DONT SUE FOR THIS NOOOOOOOW!</i>).

<p>Onute has now stays the Revived server for old school time, it will NOT update, permanent. Still permanent.

<h2>Hypocrisy issues</h2>
<p><a href="ics.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Seamus</a> just made the video Hypocrisy of Onute. But a few moments later it was removed for channel shutdown on the YouTube BonziWORLD community, now it stays named with "BonziWORLD: Revived" channel, but remember it's real!

<p>For the later, it purchased the domain name "<b>.tk</b>" (maybe she purchased Freenom website and puts the DNS?) and using Cloudflare to prevent the DDoS attacks. Now for the real IP address is unsearchable, something there is you need to find out which is real IP for hosting API services. Use CloudFail to find a real host's IP who hosted from their API service. Some for hackers did. But October 31st, the sites will be removed for cause of kiddie and boredom time. Now use 72.23.210.24 and 78.63.40.199 temporarily.

<p>ICS purchased free Freenom domains that's free. Reminder, but it's your same domain of your port if you got them.

<p>Seamus (Seamusmario 55) is no longer exists this name, it's now for new name "itzcrazyscout" or "CrazyMediumScout", "ICS".

<p>CrazyMediumScout is no longer exists this name. May be cause to deprecate.

<h2>Notes and Facts</h2>
<p>Notes are, she lives in Europe, so it time zone corrects like Finland or Lithuania, it'd actually same yes!

<p>On December 12 2019, this guy just uploaded on YouTube, his mother's YouTube channel called "<a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">onute saulute thekantapapa</a>", it reached 3,000 subs for popular videos, so for the video name called "<a href="onuteworst.html" style="text-decoration: none;">washing my foots and hands</a>", but a few moments later, it was removed their entire channel and no longer exists it. He cries too much for every day, so I was got grounded by my parents (an husband is far way on Finland it works on MANY months ago it need to pay for their cash for building and fixing, job is builder and device technology repairer). She is autistic mother in the world. I don't have a repetition for your life. WHAT THE PARENTS DO THIS, they need to go to hell or something else to go to job at businesses? Only way, when all of these works on middle school ended, my parent with black suit just asked to delete the YouTube channel for school laughs and non-pornographic audiences (he's a 13 year old right?), then the parent just cancels the apology and goes to social worker to want the son to delete this, it's like for punishment day and grounded threats in real life. Besides, son just went to home, a son's mother cry like a crybaby and hurts his feelings for posting non-pornographic videos on YouTube, but son doesn't know how did a process get. My mother starts very furious and tell about the son as inappropriate for being a pornographic poster. Then it was terribly "grounded" by my parents for doing inappropriate content, child pornography and nudity for the first time. That means it breaks Community guidelines you weren't allowed to use teenagers (kids) an pornography.

<p>WHY I AM GROUNDED? You know you are such of GoAnimator for saying "grounded". Grounded threats don't ever work! You must to have a life to unground him, not grounded!

<p>Only our social worker teacher just said anger "LAUGHTER ARE NOT SO FUNNY" and "DO YOU WANT TO CALL THE PRINCIPAL FOR POSTING FUCKING VIDEOS ON YOUTUBE?!", it said "No." for cancellation.

<p>A son has being punished on the December's 2019, it was gotten one for phones in Huawei Vodafone 845 and LG GB102 white.

<p>Our new year, yesterday it was a son's (Onute's) birthday January 8th, it was given one them an another friend Bluetooth Headset Havit, and this mother need to agree with your feelings "Do you want to agree when you won't upload any videos on YouTube within pornographic?".

<p>Some said "Yes, I agree.". Son will just learn how to prevent non-pornographic videos on YouTube, REMEMBER, they are only in 18 ages!

<p>All of those reactions in early 2020 January, named "onute salulete got hacked", it was deleted by son for doing it non-pornography videos. By Zander Blake old.

<p>On this another January time, a channel was called "<a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute Saulute</a>" (the old channel was a "onute channel thekantapapa" due to child pornography disaster, he wasn't been arrested and laugh like a grandma). At this night, it doesn't get punished for that, just that my mom watches my videos whatsoever I am watched ought too. He watches random videos like Samsung SGH-E250, Samsung R210s, Slime animations for Minecraft, AHTG videos and just like more. It watches too much videos on YouTube today.

<p>And this time, on April 14, the phone company Sony was a broken, boot.oat and boot.art not found, causes for the bootloop. Some weeks later he didn't fixed the Xperia phone with third-party application repair Sony Companion. She didn't upload on YouTube, because of phone bootloop (they have to control his account to upload videos continuously, or if not, then create with native hotspot connection). Because she tried to connect like Splius television. She was tried to do IP camera and BOOM gone boot files forever for without touching it! Why? It's because of battery did this or motherboard cause? Why you should repair? Maybe not.

<p>All of time he has NOT repaired the phone yet for VERY months. But later device was died due to the warranty of the phone in five years off. I can't do anything with this old phone, I have to disconnect the wires and clean a ROM's chip to backup them.

<p>Another phone and ZGPAX smartwatch:

<p>Gigabyte GSmart Essence - This phone was really dead and screen was screwed up for the pixels. Gsmart is always shooting like pistol when this freezes on and sounds buzz for every milliseconds, I running away that phone will cry me so painful when my phone is shooting loud noises and freezes it a little bit. This is a loud noise of Gsmart phone, it's the bad phone, why I was got this on end of 2015 when I was good son at 9-year old. My parents don't ever fake me when I was trying to do with this phone, this came with CM Security (Cheetah Mobile Security) was pre-installed on Gsmart Essence device, Battery Doctor, Clean Master, and more apps are actually pre-installed on this device, Battery Doctor does optimize by killing those apps and saving life. GSmart Essence phone is very buggy and shooting like a pistol when it freezes as exploit of Android malware. I can't sell this phone, let him here.

<p>ZGPAX S19 - This smartwatch is giving us MediaTek sounds like "uh oh" and shows the alert "Low battery shutdown" when battery is CRITICALLY empty, the camera was broken, freezes when camera is connected, ZGPAX was a bad company for old smartwatches. It died when I put the headphone jack to the USB port or warranty has ran out once again.

<h2>Versions</h2>
<p>V8.8 added the /loskyize, hell and hack commands

<p>One of them in V8.8, so it called Loskythecopydog77's basics, another one is fire up like a hell and another third is anonymous hacking.

<p>In V8.9, context menus right-click are added "Call an".

<p>All of the jokes are updated, including like slime of water.

<p>In V9, datalist for inputs are added, if you do not know for suggest.

<p>In V12, added cookies to ensure the experience from the site.

<p>In Final Version, added desktop for best experience.

<p>Next.

<p>No more updates on the BonziWORLD FE that you not start a owner working of features, because of this, it lost an interest. Some boredom gone far.

<p>Remember, don't make a owner to make more updates, or else the owner won't just be annoying to add like a borer of making BonziWORLD updates.
