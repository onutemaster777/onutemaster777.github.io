<p><b>Egy vakond58</b> (<i>known as Geri1940, Geri2020, Bowgart, PomPomCord, PomPomInflationGirl, Tiawa, or Ciawa</i>) is a 12-13 year old Hungarian boy, he started to watch <a href="samsungfunclub.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Samsung Fun Club</a>, then started to <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> episodes it is "record" the video and have subscribers on this channel.

<p><b>Rare Wubbox</b> (<i>Diogo Mendes</i>) hacked the Bowgart's account by giving him a email and password on the YouTube video comment and then got channel deleted, then got his accounts being hacked by Portuguese user on this sight. For this later, he got the channel back and his subscribers left there.

<p>Egy vagykok hates <a href="ics.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ICS</a>, because he banned him. I was started on 2019, then I hate ICS for being disruptive behavior and a kiddie for my favorite <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> website.

<p>He ever requested the website called "<b>GeriWORLD</b>", but you can <a href="http://78.63.40.199:3925" style="text-decoration: none;">get it here to chat</a>.

<p>Neither with <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a>. Daniel is the 100.000.000 billion times better than egy vagykok. Egy vagykok is still a orange-headed kid to hack BonziWORLD. But <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> is more hackful and dramatic. If you sure this, then you know. If you don't sure (<b>love Bowgart</b>), you may have a kiddies and you will be kiddies so. Get apologized.</p>
