<h1>BagelChip</h1>
<p><b>BagelChip</b> (<i>real name Nathan Thompson, born in 1977, age 43, location 13400 Gillette St Apt 39104, Overland Park, KS 66213, families Bobby Thompson, Bernadine Thompson and Berna Thompson</i>) is a well-known creator and owner on bonzi.world, beta.bonzi.world and classic.bonzi.world, but other several ways the old website called "dega.io", so the domain gets deprecated.</p>

<p>She was stop updating on all bonzi.world sites because there's no time to knew it to add new features just as VPN banning or IP tracing.</p>

<p>Now ICS hates an site and leaves him peaceful. Because she was posted at the video description saying:</p>

<p><b>I'll tell you why. During the first year of this terrible bonziworld server, We didn't have much. We basically had fun. Until later on, These manchildren came up to us and started acting like that the website is their life, and started rule breaking like crazy. Seriously, It's been 1 fucking year since this came out, and these manchildren are trying to bring it back. Not even Adela, the creator of New! BonziWORLD approves their behavior. We have detected that the average age of BonziWORLD Users are 7 years old. That's fucking serious. Not even their parents deal with this. My sibling's father didn't like this website because it had swear words. BonziWORLD was intended to be for Mature Audiences. Meanwhile, in the logs. We've found out that Bowgart was doing sexual roleplays with Diogo Mendes and Diogo enjoyed it. This isn't right, like at all. I got IP Banned from mintmaru.io over a immature action over open source software. I went crazy over Adela using my open source assets, and that was really regretful, and I'm sorry for what i've done. None of the mature users (such as: clip888) even come to the website anymore. It is all of their fault. More people are losing interest because of them children. "PLEZ I WANT BONZIWORLD REVIVD BAK PLEAS BRING IT BAK PLS" NO. N o. I don't want to bring back a monstrosity of a chat website. That'll even make me lose friends as well. The creator of BonziWORLD "heyjoeway" deeply regrets of making this project, and it's all because of these children. Nobody even understands the fact that i'm really, really mad at these users. About 90% of my audience are BonziFags, and I'm not happy about that. I want my fans to be nicer and be better than these other users. My reputation is also crumbling enough. And it's all because of the children. Acting like 5 year olds to other people, doing NSFW Roleplays (like groomed losky did 3 years ago in 2020), Doxxing themselves, making people lose interest in the chat website entirely, and also acting like a average Go!Animator. They "ground" the users like they're their parents. I even got "grounded" because I abused an exploit on classic.bonzi.world. Now, If this post hurts your teeny tiny feelings and you are ready to harrass me, Go get a life. BonziWORLD isn't your life. Nature is. And you deserve better than going in this shitty website. Go do other things, like Gaming, Schooling, or whatever. And stop playing on this monstrosity of a website.</b></p>

<p>Also do you know what ICS made a serious activity? You should to stop them okay? You should to quit BonziWORLD, because of pedophile and kiddies ruining out of every BonziWORLD site.</p>

<p>I saw the oldest date "clip888" was a brown person done for meaningness</p>

<p>But Nathan Thompson that weren't recognized their fault on YouTube.</p>

<h2>What he likes and what he dislikes</h2>
<p>The mostly likes ICS because he's a savior of BonziWORLD Revived community, he likes other to code confetti.min.js, Room ID menu without getting disconnected from the server. But he is odd percentage to code with a programming language.</p>

<p>heyjoeway - the most original in Github communication.</p>

<h2>The mostly what he dislikes:</h2>

<p>Onute - first strike: She advertised an site that redirects an link. (<i>Ban: Why? <b>ONUTEWORLD? MORE LIKE GAYWORLD.</b> When it is over? <b>one month</b>)</i></p>

<p>Onute now makes interesting website to name as "<b>FUCKWORLD</b>" (the newest is BonziWORLD FE gone hereupon).</p>

<p>Second strike: she being call an hacker and then got banned forever giving Cloudflare Error 1006 with dangerous JavaScript.</p>

<p>There is something hassle, she made me a epilepsy with Staggering Beauty sound that it is mixed together over audio editing software. She made to open random Google searches the potatoes in Lithuania. So dangerous! It should to get arrested for breaking people! Do not bomb him otherwise you will bombed back, you get permanently banned and use a free VPN constantly to be unbanned and again and again, this is your vary of human-autonomy.</p>

<p>Message to BagelChip: Nathan, I'm very sorry for doing you to be unearthed and be right of nudity on your site. Please unban me. I will never do some things like ICS madding us especially if we did.</p>

<p>What the hell, BagelChip? I wish to knock with the spatula to teach his lesson! (<i>Ban: <b>Why?</b> N/A. <b>When it is over?</b> Invalid Date</i>)</p>

<p>Nayje123 - it impersonated as BagelChip can't named anyway. (<i>Ban: <b>Why?</b> Ohi. <b>When it is over?</b> 2 days</i>)</p>

<p>It has added an protection feature to stop naming others within owner as BagelChip. On classic.bonzi.world, it will change name into PissFlaps. On bonzi.world, it will change name into Anonymous or different languages.</p>

<p>ItzChris - he did a drama on bonzi.world Discord server to engage and implicit heyjoeway and ICS, now he is fucking banned.</p>
