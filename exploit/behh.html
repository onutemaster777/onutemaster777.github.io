<h1>Behh</h1>
<p>Behh is a word that it comes from Russian letters "beh". It is added in early 2018 when random anonymous has a script code on it. As you quite, behh word makes people angry and crash TTS engine for spamming too much, and then it lags too much, because of memory. The quote of behh community said: </p>
<br>Behh is the WORST word! Itâ€™s horrendous and ugly. I hate it. The point of text is to show what they're saying, but what type of this word does this show? Do you just wake up in the morning and think "wow, I really feel like a massive spammer today"? It's useless. I hate it. It just provokes a deep rooted anger within me whenever I see it. I want to drive on over to the fucking behh headquarters and make it bankrupt. If this was in the bonziworld videos I'd go apeshit like crazy. People just comment "behh" as if it's funny. It's not. Behh deserves to die. He deserves to have his disgusting "!behhh" copy smashed in with a hammer. Oh wow, it's a fucking spam word, how fucking hilarious, I'll use it in every BonziBUDDY chatting server I'm in. NO. STOP IT. It deserves to burn in hell. Why is it so goddamn spammy? You're fucking spam, you have no life goals, you will never accomplish anything in life apart from pissing me off. When you die noone will mourn. I hope you die.<hr noshade style="color:red;">
