<h1>Heyjoeway</h1>
<p><b>Heyjoeway</b> (<i>known as Joseph Judge</i>) is a Sonic the Hedgehog 2 creator, <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> and map designer. He was a arctic vault on the GitHub website for highlights. He's online and busy to work "<b>disassemble</b>" a game called Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and "<b>remaster</b>" to other platforms. He created BonziWORLD on 2014, without GitHub account. He ever made itself, and the smaller version is no joke.

<p>Joseph Judge hates kid shows to <a href="ics.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ICS</a> because he hates him, because he hates nonsense. Squidward had enough with this.

<p>So Joseph Judge archived and shut down <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a>, because <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> issued the memecrew.html to a user reported "<b>Hex</b>" from Soundcloud is dead. He suspended the account or deleted it. But he shut down the BonziWORLD and no one can come over to join and see that "<b>OH MY GOD BONZIWORLD GOT ATTACKED!</b>".

<p>Joseph Judge doesn't ever to see the care of YouTube, other users think is to make "<b>grounded videos</b>" by using <a href="gofag.html" style="text-decoration: none;">GoAnimate</a> or other software like that. One is Onute that made a video out of Joseph Judge shutting down BonziWORLD.

<p>This video shows on Onute:

<li>she grounds him for some reasons.
<li>she gives extra punishments, colloquially is not faith
<li>changes the password
<li>takes the shower very cold for force
<li>contacts Onute to comment
<li>destroys the code on GitHub and stay the BonziWORLD
<li>she lefts away of this house to the bed
<li>regardings with crying voice
