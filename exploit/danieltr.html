<h2>What happened to Danieltr?</h2>
<p>In the end of 2021, Seamus started to mock Danieltr because he totally leaked his information out of it. This happened to the start of Feburary 2022, danieltr has been mocking everyone because he changed his behavior and started to hate ICS for no reason.<br>
And also, Danieltr leaked his Seamus Cremeens's zip code and location, which it's very illegal.<br>
Seamus called danieltr52 a clown, because he leaked and said lard for it. DanielTheClown is now an responsible one of memes coming out, bitchass!!!<br>
A little reminder, Danieltr is doing some suspicious activity from TMAFE and other websites is just "insult" as like me I did in 2020 &emp; 2021. Seamus Cremeens said if Danieltr enters a site was BonziWORLD content, he will be censored and injected with Danieltr mode and the color is clown right now.</p>
