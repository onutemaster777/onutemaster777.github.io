<h1>DanielTR52</h1>
<p><b>Daniel</b> (<i>also known as DanielTR52, DanielTheClown, PurpleOctopus</i>) is a user in BonziWORLD, BonziWORLD Revived and an administrator. But later in the end of 2021, he was harassed by one of his friends for doing suspicious activity on TMAFE.<br>
In December 14th, 2023, he apologized to Seamus for what he did from Colin's Discord server, ending up by not feeling about it and immediately apologizing to Seamus for what he has done with.</p>
<hr noshade style="color:red;">
<h2>Actions</h2>
<p><li>In the end of 2021, DanielTR started doing suspicious activity on TMAFE and he was used to destroy the community, causing Seamus to cut ties with him temporarily (before Dec. 14, 2023).</li></p>
<p><li>Meanwhile when they broke up with Seamus, Daniel leaked Seamus's location and their zip code, resulting to be very illegal.</li></p>
<p><li>He has a YouTube channel whichever was a troll channel where he makes terrible videos out of them include to leak grimagikoopa's email to social streaming platform as long as someone wants to hack it, but in mere weeks, a few channels were closed/terminated due to severe harassment. Every single DanielTR's video had a long and ridiculous title with no spaces, making Seamus to hard to identify the title.</li></p>
