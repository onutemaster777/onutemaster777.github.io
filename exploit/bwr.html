<h1>BonziWORLD Revived</h1>
<p><b>BonziWORLD Revived</b> is a revival website of the <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> with different features by <a href="ics.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ICS</a>. And the owner can ban you, kick you, warn you, admin you, unadmin you or exist you.

<p>BonziWORLD Revived was created on 2018, not 2017. BonziWORLD Revived have MASH characters spritesheets by making from Paint.NET to make spritesheets with more RAM.

<p>For more changes, BonziWORLD Revived is not your website. It's your favorite website created by a founder.

<p>BonziWORLD Revived have shut down on 2020 for late days, because it's poor experience and horribly amount for the <a href="bw.html" style="text-decoration: none;">BonziWORLD</a> community. BonziWORLD Revived rules are changed.

<p>BonziWORLD Revived have been came back for poor experience reviews. Then it shuts down for unknown reason.

<h2>Hypocrisy</h2>
<p>Due to hypocrisy, that main is <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> ever criticized and banned from BonziWORLD Revived, because she's a kiddie for now. He made grounded videos out of ICS , but ICS doesn't care for these groundings.

<p>He cloned BonziWORLD Revived by <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a>, that <a href="ics.html" style="text-decoration: none;">ICS</a> doesn't have a permission to clone this website and got the two owners and one founder is <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a>.

<p>Erik and Seamus came back on the website while <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> is still back sitting on the toilet. Seamus told him a owner to take it down and never host it again. But it doesn't.

<h2>Why they JUST shut down?</h2>
<p>Here's why BonziWORLD Revived got shut down: <a href="kiddie.html" style="text-decoration: none;">kiddies</a> ever ruin the site, <a href="kiddie.html" style="text-decoration: none;">kiddies</a> use javascript, no reactions, ground other users, <a href="onute.html" style="text-decoration: none;">Onute</a> have criticized the site for now, etc.
