<h1>Fags</h1>
<p>Fags are likely the meaning of how user should have to call to another and eventually call him a [something's favorite]fag.</p>

<h2>Fags</h2>
<p>There's the list of fags:</p>
<p><li><b>Languagefag</b> - Some of a group who hate every single language in the world which was inspired by Grounding Countries. They don't speak or say, so it was called; they were also taking someone's language down by using one of their own made 400,000 applications which they are written in lazy ass C# and C++ programming languages by using a lot of learning for Visual Basic to eliminate someone's native language and forgetting about it.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Bonzifag</b> - A group of people who hate BonziBUDDY so much and this happens to every single CollabVM user who is purely retarded and known about this purple monkey giving you spyware for no reason.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Doxfag</b> - A person who hates people for who were doxxed in public and they don't want to see someone's dox for anything.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Dramafag</b> - A person or group of people who are trusting "anti-drama" whom they stop people from getting massive drama out of single person or some of large server that has a lot of people arguing and posting shit for absolutely free speech.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Logofag</b> - A person who is making logos and effects that are literally too old like to contain very shitty 20th Century Fox where it becomes overused all the way and this actual problem for all kids who joined in YouTube like how Kyoobour9000 started in 2010 to be as the first recommended logo editor in the world.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Objectfag</b> - A person who is obsessed with Object Show stuff like how they were really obsessed was actually BFDI (full form: Battle for Dream Island). As some for who are childish and they keep watching BFDI as long as they want, they will be added as a Objectfag.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Gofag</b> - A person or someone's underage kid who uses grounded threats related to GoAnimate/Vyond towards to a normal user saying "You are grounded" and they were thinking that another user is literally a parent or someone's family in this house. This actual problem exists, because somehow in the earth over of 100,000 kids being collected by the government, letting them to be a Gofag by watching too much grounded videos including the popular one of the kids show called "Caillou" and "Dora the Explorer", but in twist, they made grounded videos out of real life/their friend/YouTube users instead of ranting on baby show characters which it can make them so retarded or even worse to get them deleted by JewTube itself.</li></p>
<p><li><b>Phonefag</b> - Some of a group that are related to BonziWORLD community who argues over the phone collectors for having like "ROMPHONIX YOU BANNED ME A LOT! NOW I WILL BALEET YOUUUU!!!" and it's like how people collect their phones for no reason. Not related to Samsungfags.</li></p>
