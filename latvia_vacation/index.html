<h1>Latvia journey for 4 days</h1>
<hr>
<p>We have been so much fun in Latvia. One of them live: my grandma, Vaida Lindemann, Sven, David and me are going to Liepaja in Latvia for 4 days, the most important favorite part of the day is the Baltic Sea on day 3, but I wasn't been drowned. I will show you how did I survive my entire journey in Latvia for 4 days.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<h3>It is possible to walk around the state of Liepaja which had a square town. For my recommendation of this language, Latvia is spoken in the official language of Latvia, but you can either speak English or Russian whether you like it. Some Ukrainians getting a flight to prevent Russians attacking Ukrainian people and they wanted to live it here, support them and feel friendly for being lived too long in Ukraine.</h3>
<p>We all wake up at 10-11 AM. During the breakfast, we're just eating a plain sandwich for many times like we just "make a site" whichever Vaida said the phrase "get financial balance". I can't wear a red zipped jacket, because it's too hot for us, like how she said. We drove to Klaipėda's border in the end and so there we go, we went to Latvia government border and we just got likely greeted to drive of Liepaja. I just never heard about Liepaja or what is that? When Lithuanians visit Liepaja in Latvia or they want to visit the Baltic Sea in Liepaja's beach, sometimes there were a lot of Lithuanians visiting rumours.</p>
<br>
<p>We just went out of the car and we just little gone to some "Maxima" shopping, it's in downstairs. My grandma has ever used "Ačiū" Maxima card, but... it failed. The card scanner thinks it's a invalid card. You're going to pay without the card for some reason. After we walk to the fountain of Liepaja, there's a public room of people talking on phones, but others had babysitters playing kids shows from YouTube app on Android. I ate three of different sandwiches: pizza sandwich, meat baguette and classic baguette. We went to the ships and we just gone too far, like how we said "sorry" to the staffs but they don't understand what am I saying like he was rumbling their hair.</p>
<br>
<p>Now that's just it, so we get in the car and drive in the hotel where Vaida knows if the manager asks to have a hotel, so don't become a homeless. Similarly as a house of the hotel, not a modern cashy 777 jackpot hobby, Sven opens the car's back and puts everything to the street floors, only they were luggages. Manager says it's on right to the second floor, we just unlock in it, but Vaida Lindemann unlocks the code of the door to unlock the access for this door. We've removed the boots, but only socks. David and me when my parents are pointing where is the room that we supposed to go, so we just play on the phones. There's one more thing that I see, this plush is a vampire and it's own meaning that has to be the video game called Minecraft - Enderman.</p>
<br>
<p>After my parents left, we play on the phones again still at 6 PM in this hotel, I don't have mobile data, because my mobile phone provider does not support it to have any European Union country coming with mobile data. "You can just skip Day 4 that we just got ourselves mobile data back in Skuodai". But don't worry, it had Huawei B535-232 built-in WiFi router in hotel which you are allowed to connect with this password, not even I checked on speedtest.net and it shows me a powerful resort for this speed: 40 mb download and 30 mb upload.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<h3>The ruins, ah yeah. And the longest national park in Latvia.</h3>
<p>We woke up in the hotel and gone driving in Riga, but who cares, it's 300 kilometers long! Jesus christ! If you think that Riga is the most powerful place to live in Latvia, you can clearly speak them. I just gone to Spice building "Rimi Hypermarket". First, I never saw this place that it had very greatful tastes on this little restaurant, you have to carry it yourself where you will choose a food. I just thinking that I like cakes so much, beyond the name "Cake Eating Fan". The cake just fell from nowhere. After I eat all on the brown plate, David and me are going to Candy pop to buy a spiral red lollipop and special DBZ "king Buu" soda bomb can. We chose the same product and bought it. I never saw that King Buu drink is the loveful taste.</p>
<br>
<p>OK... My family went out the longest stairs and we can't hold it too much, I touched the rope but it was so dangerous for me, there's a tree stick on the bottom! Oh mama!</p>
<br>
<p>I heard one family speaking English in Cafe, but holding ropes falling down to the bottom rope, I just got a weak blood on my end arm.</p>
<br>
<p>And also we went to the longest national park in Latvia, whichever it had so many stairs to step down. We get in the holes of the cave where the people live for very long time that people don't have mobile phones or something else. My family are inside on abandoned building when David wanted it. I asked my parents that it's gonna to rain in Latvia. In the end of the national park, I just getting tired over, but David doesn't get tired. I get many stings from little insects on my legs, when I get sweat and the insects thinking it's a sweet body.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Day 3</h2>
<h3>Haven't you heard about the Russian jail? We got locked for three minutes, so hot. And we just went out of the beach.</h3>
<p>We woke up for the third time. We just wanted to go to Latvia jail, but we just got trapped out by the guide whenever we were English people to see it. In other jail doors, Latvians live in this other camera room. I ordered Pols nuts ice cream, but David ordered an expensive and greatest yellow ice cream. Second, my family went to buy some first World War accessories, but David bought a mask that can prevent smoke and farting effects to your nose. The only one thing that it had Nazi? Latvia shouldn't have to place swastikas, because it's too inappropriate, and some people would become white supremacists loving Adolf Hitler whenever he died in 1940's. This person is a guide manager that guides multilingually between Latvia and English. The guide said that you will be coming back in the future for this jail in Latvia. We go to the car and get some rest to eat it.</p>
<br>
<p>I just ordered chicken nuggets with garlic sauce, french fries with dipped tomato sauce and a small Coca Cola plastic drink from the free vending machine. It was so sweet.</p>
<br>
<p>We went to the beach of Liepaja, and it's so sweet that you can go out. But this sea has had a lot of brown hairs in this sea, why can't everyone clean this mess up? Oh, never mind, you can remove it every time. After my mom shouted at me that I need to get a rest, I laid down on the blanket, applied Sun cream and waited for a few minutes, and then I went to the Baltic Sea again to get some fun resort.
</p>
<br>
<p>It was painful on the beach today. Now it's "holy fuck" my sandals filled with sand and it's getting so much pain.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Day 4</h2>
<h3>If you can't walk to the beach to see a bunker, and why do we need to support our gods in this Russian church with gold heads? I got medium gold candles for each family member of mine.</h3>
<p>First of all, we need to have a supported gold medium candle in this Russian church. I just totally forgot how to pose to support the god. We stole the facts of the Russian church and exited it.
<br>
<p>We walked out of the beach, but without boots it was really painful to walk. It has so many small rocks to walk with it. I don't wanna to get drowned for it, but no one will get me up for this stupid sea for the rest of my life. Sea is life, we can't just go back and sit there for an indefinite moment when the parents want to see the bunker in this sea to touch them. I walked with boots, and so it wasn't really painful, but just a little bit. This sea in the ground was savanna or acacia biome that you really think?
<br>
<p>We are out, we just escaped Lithuania, but it's not done yet! We are miles away to visit Lithuania, but we are still in Latvia. My family wanted to buy some candies because we are good boys walking in benefits.
<br>
<p>And then, we went to the official home and the journey has ended right now.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The End of the Latvia</h2>
<h3>We just finally went home at 6 PM.</h3>
<p>I'm just gonna continue with casual stuff and that's it. It's over now!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I think this is actually ended the journey list. What do you think about the rate of Liepaja? It's a cool place where Ukrainians and Estonians visit Latvia, and it's PREEEEEETTY long track to Riga. You may know that Riga is the most powerful state, but what Estonia? If you think that Estonia is the powerful than Latvia?! Let me know on Discord to check your silly answers. Bye-bye.</p>
