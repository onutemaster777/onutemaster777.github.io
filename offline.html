<h1>It's time to move on.</h1>
<p>As of December 14th, 2024, the website has been permanently shut down for good, it will never come back and look like before. We know we did a lot of things on the internet with most haters who don't exactly like what's going on with us, so we all admit one of our wrongdoings, but it's hard to say goodbye to one of the beautiful sites that we have ever made for fun.</p>
<h2>The worst things I have ever done</h2>
<p>Oh well, do I have to explain all over again? Look down for the evidence I have made and I don't want to waste my time for writing the same things I have did and I do not want to talk about anyone who cut ties with me or I'm relating to anything. And who are watching this, I still HAD it. I still HAD the chance to talk about it. I still HAVE the energy to talk about my past because without my past, I could not remember what happened then like in 2021 or some shit I have did without them before they get around me a lot which is totally bad, and I can't actually remember the year of 2016 for things I have did because I only know what really happened in 2017 before I abandoned my YouTube channel for 6 years before I brought my old account back in 2023. That was super unfair. The fair is do I actually have to show you what am I doing? Match three games are surprisingly awesome, don't you? Bejeweled 3 is only the game I need and I was highly obsessed with Bejeweled series and made me a lot of improvement. And so let's not talk about the gem-matching game made by PopCap Games or GameHouse, should I say. Why would you guys have to be like that? Go back to 2018 and act like this now, wouldn't you change that as a 12 year old kid who talks nonsense and do nothing at all? Why do people hate my past? There is nothing wrong about my past unless if you manipulated my friends. I just really wanted to have fun and that's all. There was only one user on Discord who saw me in the group chat or inside of normal Discord server who still knows me that I was doing back in 2015 with my forbidden username that I have used for years making logo editing content and still obsessed with "class key chew poe" (or Splaat, if you know what I mean) until I finally got rid of that thing.</p>
<p>YouTube star creators, veterans, influencers, comedians and all of my fans who helped me improve a lot better than doing the same shit thing I have made in 2021, I am really sorry for:</p>
<ol style="font-weight: bolder; font-family: 'Segoe UI', sans-serif;">
<li>doxxing myself including my face that I made on my computer where I created for fun.</li>
<li>harassing lots of people on the internet and wasting their time.</li>
<li>having a lot of shit.</li>
<li>harassing users on Minecraft Pocket Edition content in 2017.</li>
<li>harassing and saying the racist word to people on Google Chat (a.k.a. Hangouts) in 2018.</li>
<li>copying HQC's profile picture to my channel which he gave MarioTheSpartan's attention to me into taking it down with Community Guidelines strikes.</li>
<li>harassing and trolling AprilSR, Sekanor, PixelLoaf staffs on Discord in 2019.</li>
<li>interrupting people on Discord from Bejeweled Discord server in 2019.</li>
<li>being idiotic on logo editing community in September 2019 issued by The YTPMV Community.</li>
<li>telling my weight.</li>
<li>begging and making fun of OTOMAD creator TheKantapapa in 2019.</li>
<li>being banned on BWR for many times as a kiddie in 2019 for making fun of Seamus/Siobhan/Touhou Insanity.</li>
<li>posting naked videos out of myself without knowing them which it was the worst incident of my life in December 12th, 2019.</li>
<li>being permanently banned on bonzi.world by Nathan Thompson in March 2020 for making fun of the owner.</li>
<li>hosting a illegal LVM server unstoppable before I gave up which leads into leaking IP addresses and literally inviting everyone to have fun on my Discord server before I deleted it.</li>
<li>hacking Minecraft Bedrock Edition servers.</li>
<li>refusing to shut down BonziWORLD servers when Seamus told me so.</li>
<li>stealing Seamus's videos on YouTube and uploading them which made my YouTube channel terminated on my 15th birthday.</li>
<li>grabbing people's IPs.</li>
<li>raging on Discord users.</li>
<li>acting way different like Coolphonix, Miguel de Oliveira Valentin, Pseudonymous Impact and many others that I can't remember.</li>
<li>stealing phone collector's videos and refused to credit them in 2021 which resulted me in a ban for unfair reasons.</li>
<li>false doxxing an innocent Russian person which made my first Discord account being disabled.</li>
<li>calling emdicadrian satan for thousands of times on David Khoa's Discord server, blocking me.</li>
<li>harassing CUBO for being what's better to join ROMphonix as his side when I got banned from the server.</li>
<li>reviving SgtPepperArc360 Discord server via server template which is illegal.</li>
<li>trying to act like wildcat in 2022.</li>
<li>making stupid things to Seamus, the best friend, resulting in hate.</li>
<li>trying to become Liam before it got exploded by one of my friends that I already cut ties with them and no longer trusting them.</li>
<li>harassing SgtPepperArc360 with community posts which made my YouTube channel terminated on September 26th, 2022.</li>
<li>showing my friends including Seamus to hate on Karonzilla for having his rage video in 2022.</li>
<li>quickly switching and spamming Discord servers to spread the hate of David Egan.</li>
<li>trying to be fetishist with my alternative accounts including two accounts that I personally use for roleplay and dragged me into drama.</li>
<li>trying to become pagerorgy to harass him, calling his deadname and then the actual person of the community lost his privilleges which is the same user I have dealt with who said to make Soundcard to cry more on August 24th, 2023.</li>
<li>being stupid on HTwins Discord server.</li>
<li>calling Karonzilla's deadname before he cut ties with me for doing non-stop in December 2023 to February 2024.</li>
<li>failing to leave the internet.</li>
<li>making fun of Karonzilla after February 2024.</li>
<li>arguing with people for having my evidence of calling his deadname in group chat.</li>
<li>being a Warsaw member all day.</li>
<li>having trouble with the police officer for harassing Karonzilla with the same reasons I have did on Discord.</li>
<li>being permanently blocked by the ISP for port forwarding shit.</li>
<li>and much much more....</li>
</ol>
<p>I am really sorry for everything what I did. Please forgive me. I know what I did because I just wanted to have fun and collect all the drama that I made by the second. I will not become a villain anymore. I really want to forget everything what happened and I hope this won't happen to me again. Please accept my apology. For all of these users who can't leave me alone will be allowed to comment on my videos before it turns into a dust and I will unblock them to do everything they want. Please have mercy. Please give me another chance. I will succeed, let it repair itself and I will become a mature person. I want to be taken care of, I will get a new life and my career. I promise, I will never post my personal information including my face, my real name or anything that has my information in it. I deleted my YouTube channel and I will never create it again. Please remove my face on your posts and move on to your life. I will behave. I will ever behave. I'm not joking. I'm crying unless if you will do that. Please. I am really sorry for doing that. I hope things will not happen again and I will play all of my games that I love in my childhood. I deleted every single face including mine and everything on my computer. I seriously believe you. Please. Give me the chance, so I will behave as long as the apology gets accepted by the way and I will never post shit about me. I'm sorry. Please accept my apology.</p>
<p style="color:darkblue;font-style:italic;">R.I.P. ItzUltraScout - 2014-2024. You will be never forgiven.</p>
<br>Want to join a old Discord server? <a href="http://discord.gg/DpBBJkBuzQ" target="_blank">Join here.</a> (and also don't post r34 or violence. do you want us to get banned on discord for you doing that? read the rules)<br><br>
<p>My real name is Andrew (or <span style="background:black;">Andrew Gates</span> in Stockholm, Sweden).<br>
I am 18 year old man who likes technology since 2012. I grew up no more and I can't take anything else because of people for I already know, so a few of them who may still know me in 2014 to 2017 whichever was called one of my veterans after I was the logo editor outgrew with the iconic logo called Klasky Csupo Robot Logo which they made me advance to the next level. Some kids guided me with their own object show logos and I discovered Battle for Dream Island for the first time at the age of 8 in 2014 that I still remember in my childhood.<br>
My entire childhood was good for my entire life, especially with my family and we lived in the same house, and I did not take them seriously until 2018. In 2018 to current, I did a lot of bad things on the internet like how I harassed anybody on Hangouts (a.k.a. Google Chat), and again for my actions, it was completely fine for me... and I cannot actually explain everything for what really happened. This is all happening because I acted way different like in 2021, I became one of the dumbest things I have made was this channel where I insulted phone collectors resulting me in ban from phone community permanently and never returned. In October 2024, I came back to phone community again which it makes me happy to collaborate with other friends that are not involved with ROMphonix thing.<br>
And for all of my bad actions that I did in the past, I am truly sorry for everything what I did. I will never do this ever again like I won't even call you anything bad but nothing, and I just improved myself into getting a life. Some people tell that getting a life is hard and changing my ways are also hard for me to understand and it is time to take a break from the internet which it will make me forget everything what happened.</p>
<p>For all I know, it's time to go to another world of the internet, where all the happiness go without AI technology, with one of the classics don't definitely die since all people are really happy about them and they did not argue over it... but it's beyond redemption, it means we can't go back to the year of 2014.</p>

<b>THIS IS THE REASON WHY I AM WRITING THIS BECAUSE I CANNOT GIVE YOU MY PAST NAME SINCE IT IS AT RISK AND I AM NOT JOKING, ALL TRASH JOKES ARE ALREADY IN VOID, AND THE MAIN CAUSE WAS MY PRIVACY REASONS REFERRING TO MY FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO CALL ME THAT SHIT, YOU DON'T HAVE PERMISSION TO REVEAL MY OLD NAME THAT IS ALREADY RUINED IN DECEMBER 2019 AND DECEMBER 2023. DO YOU REALLY KNOW WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IN DECEMBER 25TH, 2023? I THINK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS. YOU ARE BEING A UNIRONIC RACIST SON OF A BRICK, LOWLIFE DEGENERATE, PROBLEMATIC ASSHAT AND DRAMAMONGER. THIS IS THE SHITTY PROBLEM I AM ASKING NOW WHEN I TRIED TO CHANGE MY WAYS AND KEPT THINKING ABOUT MY PAST NAME BEING CALLED BY SOMEONE ELSE WHICH WAS ONE PERSON BEFORE THE NEW YEAR OF 2024, I GOT A MENTAL BREAKDOWN AS WELL AS THEY DON'T REALIZE ME THAT I NEED TO GET MY APPRENTICE, CALLING ME PAST NAME NON-STOP INSTEAD OF CALLING ME FROM ONE OF THE IMPORTANT POWERWORDS WHO HAD AMAZING POWERS WHICH WAS ALREADY ISSUED IN MARCH 2020 WHEN I GOT IN BIG TROUBLE AND GOT BANNED ON RANDOM SKETCHY DISCORD SERVER FOR BEING FAT AND LITHUANIAN POTATO. AND YES, BECAUSE I STILL HAD ASD AND ADHD BECAUSE HOW MORONICALLY STUPID I AM AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT MYSELF ESSENTIALLY. MY PAST NAME FROM 2013 TO 2019 HAS NO LINKS TO ANYTHING ELSE THAN YOU PROVE THAT I AM ONE OF THE MEMBERS WHO ARE STILL ALIVE SINCE 2014 TO NOW WHICH WAS NOW HAPPENING TO ME AND I DIDN'T REMEMBER HOW DID IT GET ISSUED! AND AFTER I POSTED HIS DUMB EXCUSE OUT OF HIM ON MY TROLL YOUTUBE CHANNEL, I FEEL THAT I WAS MANIPULATED BY HIM BUT HE TELLS ME THAT I AM NOT, ALREADY CUT TIES WITH ME AND NOW I DID SOMETHING SHIT TO HIS LIVING HELL WITH THE SAME PERSON WHERE I AM ONLY AFFILIATED TO THE REST OF THE COMMUNITY AS MY MAIN LINK TO TALK WITH DISGUSTING BRATS WHO DON'T KNOW HOW TO COMMUNICATE, A FEW MOMENTS LATER HE MADE HIM FEEL DEMOTIVATED BECAUSE OF MY ACTIONS DUE TO THE WORST INCIDENT HAPPENED IN MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I CANNOT TAKE IT ANY LONGER. IF ANYONE WHO IS SEEING THIS MESSAGE, ENOUGH PLAYING GAMES, STOP PLAYING UNFAIR CARDS, STOP DRAGGING ME INTO DRAMA, I AM NOT WITH THAT ANYMORE, IT'S GETTING EVEN WORSE THAN YOU KEEP ARGUING SHIT ABOUT ME THAT I DON'T DO SHIT AND I AM NOT JEALOUS FOR MAKING A LOT OF BULLSHIT. I AM SICK AND TIRED OF YOUR CRAP FOR GETTING ME INTO BIG TROUBLE IN REAL LIFE; FORCING ME TO DO THINGS THAT GOT ME RUINED AND GMK IS ONE OF THE TROUBLE THAT HE IS MY ARCH-NEMESIS FOR TELLING ME I HAVE A LOT OF MENTAL DISORDERS AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS DUE TO MY SHIT I MADE A HALF DECADE AGO WHEN I WAS 12, STILL DOING IT BECAUSE THEY AUTOMATICALLY TOLD ME THAT GO FUCK MYSELF IF I DON'T ACT MY AGE AND I WANT TO GIVE UP FROM DOING THAT.
